1.  Introduction

   The purpose of this document is to explain and specify the usage of
   all the headers of the protocol designed by Ioannis Koulouras for the
   lab of the class.

   This document follows the keyword use as specified in RFC2119
   [RFC2119].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms:

      Protocol - A pre-approved communication language between two end
      systems.

      Server - The part of the communication protocol that receives the
      request.  In this project the server is an endpoint for a
      database.

      Client - The part of the communication protocol that starts the
      request.  In this project the client is a student application that
      requests subscription to the student's database.

      byte - An 8-bit octet

      char - A byte representing a character

      array - A data structure that houses same type data in series

3.  Protocol Overview

   Figure 1 provides a detailed high-level overview of the message
   exchange between the server and the client.

   The client sends a request to the server with the type of operation
   and the number to apply the operation on.

   The server responds with a string containing the number and/or error
   messages, up to 256 bytes in length.

                          Server                        Client
                          |                                  |
                          |        Request from client       |
                          | <------------------------------- |
                          |                                  |
                          |       Response from server       |
                          | -------------------------------> |

                         Figure 1: Message Exchange

4.  Protocol Header Format

   The following headers are required in order to satisfy all the
   requirements

   This is the structure of the message used to communicate between the
   client and the server


                 Function
                  symbol          Arguments           Content
                  +-----+------+------+------+------+---------+
                  |  c  |  a1  |  a2  |  a3  |  a4  |   con   |
                  +-----+------+------+------+------+---------+


                          Figure 2: Message format

4.1.  Function symbol field

   Specifies to the server which arithmetic operation is should apply to
   the arguments.

   *  Function - 1 byte char

   *  The character SHOULD be encoded using UTF-8.

   *  When the server responds to the client, its value SHOULD be a 0
      represented as a character

4.2.  Argument fields

   Contains a number the server will apply the function-arithmetic
   operation to.

   *  Argument - 2 byte unsigned integer

   *  The message MUST include 4 arguments.

   *  Arguments after the absolutely necessary for the specified
      function field SHOULD be set to 0.

   *  When the server responds to the client, all argument fields should
      be set to 0.

4.3.  Content

   Contains the response from the server to the client.

   *  Content - array of 256 1 byte chars

   *  The field SHOULD be encoded using UTF-8.

   *  Remaining space MUST be padded with NULL bytes.

   *  When a client sends a request to the server, this field SHOULD be
      only NULL bytes.

5.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to acknowledge all the students who will
   attempt to define their own specification.

   The authors would also like to thank all the students for their
   patients and their participation.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo makes no requests to IANA.

   You could though! ;)

7.  Security Considerations

   There is no security in this specification.  This is a prototype and
   all messages should be sent in cleartext over the wire.

   This is a VERY unsecure protocol.  Please do not implement.
